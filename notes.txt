My personal values are greatly influenced by my faith as a Christian. I believe that the Bible offers us many lessons on what we should value in our lives and the kind of person we should strive to be. With that as my fundamental backdrop, I've selected five traits that I hope that others are able to see in me based on my actions. For each trait, I've also highlighted ways in which striving to achieve them guides both my professional and personal life.

Wisdom
	

Patience

Curiosity

Integrity

Humility



Ultimately, achieving each of these traits is about being able to assist others in finding and experiencing joy in their lives. For me, Joy can best be described as a feeling of deep satisfaction, appreciation and wholeness. Joy can be found via the broad brushstrokes of our lives but also in the smaller details. Below is an interactive picture-board of some of the things that bring me Joy, both professionally and personally.

Watching my son learn and grow
Spending time with my family
Playing music with my friends
Finding the one line of code that's been causing everyone grief!
The 1% chance that what you've built works perfectly first time
Seeing something you know a friend/colleague has worked hard on come to fruition
Someone scores a really fancy goal at five-a-side (bonus if it was me!)
An architectural problem having an elegant solution
Uncovering a problem before it blows up into a bigger issue


Lastly, I'd like to share my take on what I think makes a great team. Not just the building blocks, but the signs that what you've achieved together was only possible because you were part of a great team.
